Here are some tips to get you started:\\nCapture a familiar subject or scene from an unexpected angle. Get up close and let a face cover the entire frame, or make a puppy look large by shooting from ground-level as she stares down. Find a high vantage point to show the wider context of a festival scene or bustling market.\\nUse geometry to your advantage. Look for graphic lines ‚Äî in bridges or telephone wires ‚Äî that converge to a vanishing point in your composition. Find a new way to capture patterns in everyday places, like the wheels of bicycles lined up in a rack, or symmetrical bricks in an unruly garden.\\nPlay an eye trick. Defy gravity with simple editing, like rotating the frame. Recruit a friend to make a well-timed leap, that, when rotated, looks like they‚Äôre flying through air. Or turn a dandelion into a human-size parasol by playing with scale and distance.\\n\\nPROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperspective hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.
